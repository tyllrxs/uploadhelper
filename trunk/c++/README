4) Installation
---------------

4.1) Windows 2000 & XP & Vista
------------------------------

- Compiling source code

To build the program on Windows, MinGW [ www.mingw.org ] are required, 
which are the GCC compiler for Windows and Unix environments respectively.  
Other requirements include the library wxWidgets [ www.wxwidgets.org ],
built with the options: --enable-unicode,
as well as the library CURL [ curl.haxx.se ].
Once you have the above requirements you can change to the directory where the source 
code was unpacked and type:
# make BUILD=win32

With this, the executable will be generated. After that, you can copy the executable to
another place and run it from there.

4.2) Linux
----------

- Compiling source code

GCC and the program make are required to build the program in the Linux.
Other requirements include the library wxWidgets [ www.wxwidgets.org ], built with
the options: --enable-unicode,
as well as the library CURL [ curl.haxx.se ].
Usually you can type:
# sudo apt-get install libcurl4-gnutls-dev libwxbase2.8-dev libwxgtk2.8-dev
to meet the above requirements.
  
Once you have the above requirements you can change to
the directory where the source code was unpacked and type:
# ./configure
# make

With this, the executable will be generated. After that, you can copy the executable to
another place and run it from there. To do this, type:
# su
# make install

4.3) Mac OS X
----------

- Compiling source code

This has not been tested but should work using the same steps as Linux. Please report
your experiences.
